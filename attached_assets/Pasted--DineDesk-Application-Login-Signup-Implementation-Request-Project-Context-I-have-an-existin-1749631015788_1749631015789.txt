# DineDesk Application - Login & Signup Implementation Request

## Project Context
I have an existing DineDesk application and need to add authentication functionality with login and signup pages.

## Requirements

### 1. Signup Page
- **Fields Required:**
  - Name (text input)
  - Email (email input with validation)
  - Password (password input)
  - Confirm Password (password input with matching validation)
- **Validation:**
  - All fields are required
  - Email format validation
  - Password minimum 6 characters
  - Confirm password must match password
  - Check if email already exists before signup
- **Functionality:**
  - Store user data in JSON file as dictionary format
  - Show success message after successful signup
  - Redirect to login page after signup

### 2. Login Page
- **Fields Required:**
  - Email (email input)
  - Password (password input)
- **Functionality:**
  - Validate credentials against JSON file data
  - Server-side authentication and verification
  - Show error message for invalid credentials
  - Redirect to main DineDesk application after successful login

### 3. Data Storage (Temporary Solution)
- Store user credentials in JSON file format
- Structure: `{"users": [{"name": "John", "email": "john@email.com", "password": "plaintext"}]}`
- **Note:** This is temporary - passwords stored in plain text for now, will implement proper hashing later

### 4. Technical Specifications
- **Backend:** Server-side validation and authentication
- **Frontend:** Clean, responsive UI forms
- **Error Handling:** Proper error messages for validation failures
- **Security:** Basic client-side validation + server-side verification
- **File Management:** Read/write JSON file for user data storage

### 5. User Experience
- Clean, professional design matching existing DineDesk theme
- Loading states during form submission
- Clear success/error messages
- Form validation feedback
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 6. Implementation Notes
- Create separate routes for `/signup` and `/login`
- Implement proper form handling with POST requests
- Add basic session management after login
- Include navigation between login and signup pages
- Ensure JSON file is created if it doesn't exist

## Deliverables Expected
1. Complete signup page with form validation
2. Complete login page with authentication
3. Server-side code for handling authentication
4. JSON file structure for user data storage
5. Basic routing between pages
6. Error handling and user feedback
7. Integration instructions for existing DineDesk app

## Technology Preferences
- Use the same technology stack as existing DineDesk application
- Ensure compatibility with current codebase
- Follow existing coding patterns and conventions

**Important:** This is a temporary authentication solution. The final implementation will include proper password hashing, database storage, and enhanced security measures. For now, focus on functionality and user experience with simple JSON file storage.
